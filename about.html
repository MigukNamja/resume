            Developed the C4(r) Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) SNMP
            agent, authored the bulk of the MIBs, and architected many parts of
            the intra-card data infrastructure. Challenges included performance,
            memory footprint, code maintainability, and speed of new feature
            introduction and verification. Today, this family of CMTS cable
            head-end routers carry traffic for 100M+ cable data subscribers and
            has #1 worldwide market share.

            half of my career. Am experienced and familiar with a wide array of
            architectures.
